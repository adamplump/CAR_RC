The RC car was created for the competition at the Gdańsk University of Technology. Each team had to drive a designed remote-controlled car through an obstacle course created on the day of the competition and complete the following tasks:
- start from a standstill and drive to the loading area, load an aluminum block measuring 50x50x50 mm and drive with it over a ramp,
- drive over uneven ground made of pebbles,
- negotiate a bend with an external radius of 200 mm,
- drive with a load along a straight section of road two meters long at a speed of at least 0.5 m/s,
- unload the block onto the indicated field with a platform,
- open the garage with a special button and at the end — park in this garage backwards. A total of 135 points were up for grabs.

The appearance of the designed car also counted in the competition.

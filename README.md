The RC car was created for the competition at the Gdańsk University of Technology. Each team had to drive a designed remote-controlled car through an obstacle course created on the day of the competition and complete the following tasks:
- start from a standstill and drive to the loading area, load an aluminum block measuring 50x50x50 mm and drive with it over a ramp,
- drive over uneven ground made of pebbles,
- negotiate a bend with an external radius of 200 mm,
- drive with a load along a straight section of road two meters long at a speed of at least 0.5 m/s,
- unload the block onto the indicated field with a platform,
- open the garage with a special button and at the end — park in this garage backwards. A total of 135 points were up for grabs,
- the car must fit within the dimensions of the track and garage.

The appearance of the designed car also counted in the competition.

<h3>1. Remote controlled car designed.</h3>
Most of the elements were designed for 3D printing and the remaining parts were purchased from online stores or were salvaged from projects from previous years, such as the engine and Arduino, tires.

<h3>2. Body and chassis components.</h3>
For the needs of the project, a specially designed chassis system was designed with shock absorbers, a differential mechanism, a steering trapezoid and planetary gears in the wheels as well as on the engine shaft (due to the engine's excessive power in relation to what was needed even with minimal control of its speed)
